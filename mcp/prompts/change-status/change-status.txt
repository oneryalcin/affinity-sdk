You need to change the workflow status for ${entityName} on the "${listName}" list to "${newStatus}".

Please:
1. Use find-entities to locate the entity by name
2. Use find-lists to find the list (if not using list ID)
3. Use resolve-workflow-item to find the list entry ID
4. Use get-list-workflow-config to verify the status value is valid
5. Use set-workflow-status to make the change

If there's a reason for the status change, also:
- Use add-note to document why the status changed
- Log any recent interaction that prompted this change

Reason for status change (if provided): ${reason}
