You just completed a ${interactionType} with ${personName}.

Please help me:
1. **Log the interaction** using the log-interaction tool with:
   - Type: ${interactionType}
   - Subject: ${subject}
   - Notes about the conversation

2. **Update the workflow status** if appropriate:
   - First, use find-lists to identify relevant pipeline lists
   - Use resolve-workflow-item to find their list entry
   - Use set-workflow-status to update their status if the interaction warrants a change

3. **Add any follow-up notes** using add-note if there are important details to capture

Interaction summary to log:
${summary}
